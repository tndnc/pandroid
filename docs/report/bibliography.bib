    abstract="Fitness landscapes are an important concept in molecular evolution. Many important examples of landscapes in physics and combinatorial optimization, which are widely used as model landscapes in simulations of molecular evolution and adaptation, are ``elementary'', i.e., they are (up to an additive constant) eigenfunctions of a graph Laplacian. It is shown that elementary landscapes are characterized by their correlation functions. The correlation functions are in turn uniquely determined by the geometry of the underlying configuration space and the nearest neighbor correlation of the elementary landscape. Two types of correlation functions are investigated here: the correlation of a time series sampled along a random walk on the landscape and the correlation function with respect to a partition of the set of all vertex pairs.",

abstract="In the past, the notion of fitness landscapes has found widespread adoption. Many different methods have been developed that provide a general and abstract framework applicable to any optimization problem. We formally define fitness landscapes, provide an in-depth look at basic properties and give detailed explanations and examples of existing fitness landscape analysis techniques. Moreover, several common test problems or model fitness landscapes that are frequently used to benchmark algorithms or analysis methods are examined and explained and previous results are consolidated and summarized. Finally, we point out current limitations and open problems pertaining to the subject of fitness landscape analysis.",

abstract="We evaluate the performance of estimating the number of local optima by estimating their proportion in the search space using simple random sampling (SRS). The performance of this method is compared against that of the jackknife method. The methods are used to estimate the number of optima in two landscapes of random instances of some combinatorial optimisation problems. SRS provides a cheap, unbiased and accurate estimate when the proportion is not exceedingly small. We discuss choices of confidence interval in the case of extremely small proportion. In such cases, the method more likely provides an upper bound to the number of optima and can be combined with other methods to obtain a better lower bound. We suggest that SRS should be the first choice for estimating the number of optima when no prior information is available about the landscape under study.",
