    <string name="about_title">About us</string>
    <string name="about_text">This application is developed as a Master\'s project at the science
        faculty of Sorbonne Université. One focus is the study of a combinatorial satisfaction problem
        named Locally-Envy-Free (LEF) and we want to evaluate the difficulty of a given instance for a human resolution.</string>
    <string name="about_text_2">This prototype presents the problem as a puzzle game and allows us to
        collect resolution data for a set of preselected instances. This data will be used to study the
        correlation between instance features and human evaluated difficulty.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_step1">1. In this puzzle game a number of persons are placed in a row and your goal is to choose and give a
        different resource to each person.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_step2">2. Everyone has its own preferences concerning the resources. Those preferences are aligned in columns under each person; for example
        the first person on the left prefers <font fgcolor="#599BFC">water</font> over <font fgcolor='#FEDC61'>power</font> and prefers <font fgcolor='#FEDC61'>power</font> over
        the <font fgcolor="#74C642">leaf</font>.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_step3">3.The goal is to distribute those resources between our agents without creating any jealousy between them. When you assign a
        resource to a person, you have to be sure that the persons next to him, left side or right side do not prefer that resource over the one they\'ve been
        assigned with. The same goes for the person itself.\n\nFor example, we have 3 person Alex, Bob and Charly : let\'s suppose you assign the
        <font fgcolor="#599BFC">water</font> to Bob. If the resource given to Bob is in a higher position than the one that Alex or Charly have been
        assigned to in their preferences, they will be "jealous" of Bob. Here, you see that Alex has the <font fgcolor='#FEDC61'>power</font>, but he clearly
        prefers <font fgcolor="#599BFC">water</font> over the <font fgcolor='#FEDC61'>power</font> and he sees that Bob has the <font fgcolor="#599BFC">water</font>,
        therefore he\'s jealous.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_step4">By default, you will not be able to see which persons are envious of a neighbor but you can enable a red display for them
        by tapping the button shown below.
