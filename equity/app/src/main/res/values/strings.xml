    <string name="about_title">About us</string>
    <string name="about_text">This application is developed as a Master\'s project at the science
        faculty of Sorbonne Université. One focus is the study of a combinatorial satisfaction problem
        named Locally-Envy-Free (LEF) and we want to evaluate the difficulty of a given instance for a resolution by a person.</string>
    <string name="about_text_2">This prototype presents the problem as a puzzle game and allows us to
        collect resolution data for a set of preselected instances. This data will be used to study the
        correlation between instance features and human evaluated difficulty.</string>

    <string name="tutorial_step1">1. This is a puzzle game with several actors to which you need to give
    resources. Each one has to get a different resource.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_step2">2. Every actor has its own preferences concerning the resources. For example the first actor
    prefers power over water and prefers water over the leaf.</string>
    <string name="tutorial_step3">3. No actor can be jealous of its left and right neighbors for a solution to be accepted. For example, if you give the leaf
        to the first actor and power to the second, the first agent is jealous because it would prefer power over the leaf.</string>
